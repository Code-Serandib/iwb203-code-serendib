## Analytical Insights

### Influence Index Calculator

#### Features

- **Survey Modal** for collecting stakeholder details on Power, Legitimacy, and Urgency.
- Dynamic influence calculation based on stakeholder type.
- Integration with a backend API to retrieve the calculated influence index.
- Visual feedback on the influence result, categorized into low, medium, or high influence levels.

#### How It Works

This project uses a form-based approach to gather data about stakeholders' Power, Legitimacy, and Urgency. Each factor is derived from a series of survey questions, and the scores are   normalized to values between 0 and 10.

##### Steps:

1. Power: Evaluates the stakeholder's role, authority, and control over resources or decision-making.
2. Legitimacy: Measures the stakeholder's standing in relation to their official role, expertise, or recognized authority.
3. Urgency: Assesses the immediacy and importance of the stakeholder's needs or issues.
4. The survey responses are converted into a numerical score, and these scores are used to compute the Influence Index.

##### Influence Calculation:

1. Each survey question provides a set of options, and the selected option is mapped to a score.
2. The score is normalized and calculated as a factor out of 10 for Power, Legitimacy, and Urgency.
3. The three factors are then passed to a backend API that computes the overall Influence Index using custom logic.

### Nash Equilibrium Calculator

This project is a Nash Equilibrium Calculator designed for a stakeholder management system. It helps to compute the Nash equilibrium for a set of stakeholders with various strategies,  facilitating decision-making in strategic interactions between multiple players (stakeholders).

#### Features

- Support for 2 or 3 players (stakeholders).
- Flexible input of strategic options for each player.
- Input system for payoff matrices corresponding to player strategies.
- Calculates the Nash Equilibrium by using an external API.
- Displays results in an intuitive and interactive payoff matrix with Nash equilibrium points highlighted.

#### Usage

> Once you have the frontend running, follow these steps: 

1. Enter the names of 2 or 3 players (stakeholders).
2. Define the number of strategic options for each player.
3. Specify the options for each player.
4. Input the payoffs for each combination of options.
5. Click `Calculate Nash Equilibrium` to submit the form. The system will display the Nash equilibrium points in the matrix.

#### Components

> The key components used in this project are: 

1. Player Input: For entering the player names.
2. Option Counts Input: Allows input of the number of strategies each player has.
3. Options Input: For specifying strategic options.
4. Payoffs Input: For entering payoff values for each strategy combination.
5. NashMatrixDisplay: Displays the Nash equilibrium result in a matrix format with highlighted equilibrium points.

### Social Exchange Calculator

It is part of a stakeholder management system designed to help organizations calculate the social exchange value of stakeholders based on the benefits they bring and the costs they  incur.

#### Features

- Benefit Survey: Allows you to calculate stakeholder benefits based on various factors like financial, strategic, operational, and social contributions.
- Cost Survey: Lets you calculate stakeholder costs by assessing financial, strategic, operational, and reputational factors.
- Relationship Value Calculation: Computes the social exchange value based on the benefit-to-cost ratio, helping you determine the value of stakeholder relationships.

#### How It Works

##### Benefit Survey

> The Benefit Survey allows users to provide input on stakeholder contributions across different areas:

1. Financial: Revenue, cost reductions, funding, etc.
2. Strategic: Market access, knowledge sharing, brand enhancement.
3. Operational: Efficiency improvements, skill development, service delivery.
4. Social: Contributions to CSR, sustainability, and inclusion.

> The user input is weighted and calculated to determine an overall benefit score.

##### Cost Survey

> The Cost Survey assesses the costs associated with a stakeholder:

1. Financial: Expenditures, resource allocation.
2. Strategic: Opportunity costs, risk management efforts.
3. Operational: Workflow disruptions, increased logistics.
4. Reputational: Risk of negative publicity, brand impact.

> The cost inputs are weighted and processed to generate a total cost score.

##### Social Exchange Calculation

Once the benefit and cost values are entered or calculated through the surveys, the system submits this data to the backend API `(/api/social_exchange_cal)` to calculate the Social  Exchange Value. This value helps in determining the overall relationship value with the stakeholder, guiding future strategic decisions.

### Stakeholder System Theories

> This calculates various stakeholder metrics for `Stakeholder System Theories` including:

- **Stakeholder Influence Matrix (SIM)**
- **Dynamic Stakeholder Impact (DSI)**
- **Systemic Influence Score (SIS)**
- **Stakeholder Network Stability (SNS)**

#### Features

> The application offers the following features:

##### Stakeholder Influence Matrix (SIM)

- Calculate and visualize the influence that stakeholders have on each other.

##### Dynamic Stakeholder Impact (DSI)

- Determine how behavior changes in one stakeholder can dynamically affect others.

##### Systemic Influence Score (SIS)

- Measure the overall influence a stakeholder has within the system.

##### Stakeholder Network Stability (SNS)

- Assess the stability of the stakeholder network based on behavior changes.

##### Manage Stakeholders

- Add, edit, or remove stakeholders.
- Update stakeholder connection strength, influence, and delta behavior dynamically.

#### Usage

1. Add stakeholders and their respective details including name, connection strength, and influence.
2. Calculate any of the stakeholder metrics by switching between tabs: SIM, DSI, SIS, and SNS.
3. View the results directly on the page, displayed in a formatted structure.

### Engagement Drop Calculator - Stakeholder Management System

This for calculating the engagement drop of stakeholders within a stakeholder management system. It gathers stakeholder-related data through surveys and calculates engagement drop using  input data such as the `stakeholder's weight at the start (Ws)`, `weight at the end (We)`, `stakeholder influence (Si)`, and `engagement influence (Ei)`. The result is sent to a  backend API for processing. 

#### Features

- Dynamic forms to capture stakeholder-specific data.
- Surveys to calculate normalized scores for stakeholder weight, influence, and engagement.
- Integration with an API to compute engagement drop alerts.
- Use of modern React UI components such as dialogs, input fields, and radio buttons.

#### Usage

##### Surveys

> The app presents four surveys:

1. **Stakeholder Weight Start (Ws) Survey** 
Questions assessing the initial engagement level of the stakeholder in the project.

2. **Stakeholder Weight End (We) Survey** 
Questions assessing the final engagement level of the stakeholder after project completion.

3. **Stakeholder Influence (Si) Survey** 
Questions evaluating the stakeholder's influence in the project and organization.

4. **Engagement Influence (Ei) Survey** 
Questions determining the stakeholder's responsiveness, feedback quality, and participation during the project.

> Each survey consists of multiple-choice questions, and scores are normalized between 0.0 and 1.0.

##### Engagement Drop Calculation

To calculate the engagement drop:

1. Enter the values for Ws, We, Si, and Ei for each stakeholder.
2. Optionally, click on the info icons next to each field to open a survey that will calculate the respective value automatically.
3. After filling out the form, click Submit Survey to calculate the normalized score for each section.
4. Upon form submission, the application sends the data to an API (http://localhost:9091/api/engagement_drop_alert) to compute the engagement drop alert.

##### Adding New Stakeholders

To add multiple stakeholders, click the Add Stakeholder button to dynamically add new sections for input. Each stakeholderâ€™s details can be individually calculated.
