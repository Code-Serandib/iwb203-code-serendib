## Analytical Insights

### Influence Index Calculator

#### Features

- **Survey Modal** for collecting stakeholder details on Power, Legitimacy, and Urgency.
- Dynamic influence calculation based on stakeholder type.
- Integration with a backend API to retrieve the calculated influence index.
- Visual feedback on the influence result, categorized into low, medium, or high influence levels.

#### How It Works

This project uses a form-based approach to gather data about stakeholders' Power, Legitimacy, and Urgency. Each factor is derived from a series of survey questions, and the scores are   normalized to values between 0 and 10.

##### Steps:

1. Power: Evaluates the stakeholder's role, authority, and control over resources or decision-making.
2. Legitimacy: Measures the stakeholder's standing in relation to their official role, expertise, or recognized authority.
3. Urgency: Assesses the immediacy and importance of the stakeholder's needs or issues.
4. The survey responses are converted into a numerical score, and these scores are used to compute the Influence Index.

##### Influence Calculation:

1. Each survey question provides a set of options, and the selected option is mapped to a score.
2. The score is normalized and calculated as a factor out of 10 for Power, Legitimacy, and Urgency.
3. The three factors are then passed to a backend API that computes the overall Influence Index using custom logic.

### Nash Equilibrium Calculator

This project is a Nash Equilibrium Calculator designed for a stakeholder management system. It helps to compute the Nash equilibrium for a set of stakeholders with various strategies,  facilitating decision-making in strategic interactions between multiple players (stakeholders).

#### Features

### Social Exchange Calculator

It is part of a stakeholder management system designed to help organizations calculate the social exchange value of stakeholders based on the benefits they bring and the costs they  incur.

#### Features

- Benefit Survey: Allows you to calculate stakeholder benefits based on various factors like financial, strategic, operational, and social contributions.
- Cost Survey: Lets you calculate stakeholder costs by assessing financial, strategic, operational, and reputational factors.
- Relationship Value Calculation: Computes the social exchange value based on the benefit-to-cost ratio, helping you determine the value of stakeholder relationships.

#### How It Works

##### Benefit Survey

> The Benefit Survey allows users to provide input on stakeholder contributions across different areas:

1. Financial: Revenue, cost reductions, funding, etc.
2. Strategic: Market access, knowledge sharing, brand enhancement.
3. Operational: Efficiency improvements, skill development, service delivery.
4. Social: Contributions to CSR, sustainability, and inclusion.

> The user input is weighted and calculated to determine an overall benefit score.

##### Cost Survey

> The Cost Survey assesses the costs associated with a stakeholder:

1. Financial: Expenditures, resource allocation.
2. Strategic: Opportunity costs, risk management efforts.
3. Operational: Workflow disruptions, increased logistics.
4. Reputational: Risk of negative publicity, brand impact.

> The cost inputs are weighted and processed to generate a total cost score.

##### Social Exchange Calculation

Once the benefit and cost values are entered or calculated through the surveys, the system submits this data to the backend API `(/api/social_exchange_cal)` to calculate the Social  Exchange Value. This value helps in determining the overall relationship value with the stakeholder, guiding future strategic decisions.

### Project Risk Calculation

This calculates the **Project Risk** of stakeholders in a **Stakeholder Management System** by considering various factors such as `stakeholder involvement`, `influence`, and `satisfaction` during project execution. The tool uses survey-based inputs to evaluate these risk factors and provides a risk level and actionable insights.

#### Features

- **Dynamic Risk Input Forms**: Users can input stakeholder data such as weight and influence, which are collected via interactive forms.
- **Survey Modal**: The app includes predefined surveys for evaluating different aspects of stakeholder engagement, contribution, and influence.
- **Real-time Calculation**: Once the input is provided, the project risk is calculated and displayed, including a risk score, risk level, and recommended action.

#### How It Works

1. **Survey Input**: The app provides four main survey areas, each related to a specific risk factor:

   - **Ws (Stakeholder Weight Start)**
   - **We (Stakeholder Weight End)**
   - **Si (Stakeholder Influence)**
   - **Ei (Engagement Influence)**
   
  > Each survey asks multiple questions, and users select from predefined options that correspond to specific scores. These scores are normalized to a scale of 0-1.

2. **Risk Input Set**: Each set of inputs is related to a specific stakeholder, including their weight and influence. Users can add multiple risk input sets to represent various  stakeholders.

3. **Calculation**: The data from these surveys and risk inputs are sent to the backend API, which returns:

   - **Total Project Risk**: A score representing the overall project risk based on the provided inputs.
   - **Risk Level**: A descriptive risk level such as "Low," "Moderate," or "High."
   - **Actionable Steps**: Recommended actions based on the calculated risk level.

#### Usage

1. Navigate to the Project Risk Calculator page.
2. Complete the surveys and enter stakeholder details.
3. Click `Submit` to calculate the risk.
4. The result will display the `overall project risk`, `risk level`, and `actions` to be taken based on the calculation.

### Risk Score Calculation

This is part of a stakeholder management system that calculates the risk score of stakeholders based on surveys measuring various factors such as their `role`, `contribution`, and  `engagement`. 

#### Features

- **Surveys for Risk Evaluation**: Users fill in four surveys with questions that evaluate stakeholder engagement, influence, and contribution to the project.
- **Risk Score Calculation**: The system calculates a normalized risk score (between 0 and 1) based on survey responses and provides a risk level classification.
- **Interactive Modals**: Surveys are presented within modals for better user experience, with real-time score updates.

#### Components

##### RiskScoreForm

This is the main component that handles the risk score calculation. It consists of multiple survey sections for:

- **Stakeholder Weight Start (Ws)**: Evaluates the initial contribution and role of the stakeholder.
- **Stakeholder Weight End (We)**: Assesses the stakeholder's involvement and satisfaction at the end of the project.
- **Stakeholder Influence (Si)**: Measures the stakeholder's influence and authority in decision-making.
- **Engagement Influence (Ei)**: Evaluates the stakeholder's engagement, responsiveness, and problem-solving capabilities.

> Each survey is displayed in a modal dialog where users can answer multiple-choice questions.

##### Surveys

The project includes four distinct surveys, each focusing on a different aspect of stakeholder assessment:

- **Stakeholder Weight Start (Ws)**: Evaluates the stakeholder's role, experience, and involvement.
- **Stakeholder Weight End (We)**: Analyzes how the stakeholder's involvement changed during the project.
- **Stakeholder Influence (Si)**: Measures the stakeholderâ€™s power, decision-making authority, and influence on others.
- **Engagement Influence (Ei)**: Assesses the stakeholder's engagement, responsiveness, and initiative.

##### Risk Score Calculation

The calculation is done as follows:

- Each survey question is assigned a score based on the selected answer (normalized on a 0-1 scale).
- These scores are collected for each survey and summed up.
- The frontend sends the results (`Ws`, `We`, `Si`, and `Ei`) to the backend API, which calculates the final risk score and risk level.

#### Usage

1. Open the form and fill in the values for each of the surveys.
2. Submit the form to calculate the risk score.
3. The calculated risk score and its level will be displayed on the screen.

### Balanced Scorecard (BSC) Calculator

This is for calculating the `Balanced Scorecard (BSC)` of stakeholders in a stakeholder management system. The `BSC` is a performance measurement framework that helps organizations  align business activities with the vision and strategy of the organization by evaluating stakeholders in four key areas: `financial`, `customer`, `internal processes`, and `learning &  growth`. 

#### Features

- Calculation of the `BSC index (BSCi)` based on input weights and survey data.
- Real-time data submission to the backend using Axios for BSC calculation.
- Modular components for the survey and score calculation.

#### Usage

1. Open the application and fill in the weight values for each BSC perspective using the available input fields or surveys.
2. The four perspectives of the Balanced Scorecard:

   - Financial (Wf)
   - Customer (Wc)
   - Internal Processes (Wp)
   - Learning & Growth (Wl)

3. After filling in the data, click the Submit button. The data will be sent to the backend API, and the BSC index and decision will be displayed based on the calculated result.

#### Components

##### SurveyModal

- Displays the survey for each `BSC` perspective and collects answers from the user.

##### BSCForm

- Main form for submitting weight values and calculating the `BSC index`.
- Handles `input validation`, `form submission`, and `communication` with the backend.

### Engagement Priority Score (EPS) Calculator

This is for calculating the `Engagement Priority Score (EPS)` of stakeholders in a stakeholder management system. The EPS is calculated based on various weighted factors such as `stakeholder engagement`, `influence`, `interest`, and more. These factors are input via surveys, and the scores are normalized and sent to the backend for further processing.

#### Features

- Dynamic surveys for collecting stakeholder data across different criteria.
- Calculation of Engagement Priority Score (EPS) using weights for various stakeholder attributes.
- Integration with an API to submit calculated EPS scores and retrieve results.

#### Key Components

##### Surveys

The EPS is based on five categories, each with its own set of survey questions:

1. **Engagement Weight (We)**: Measures the frequency and quality of the stakeholderâ€™s engagement.
2. **Influence Weight (Wi)**: Measures the formal and informal authority of the stakeholder.
3. **Stakeholder Interest (Ws)**: Measures the stakeholderâ€™s relevance, gain, and risks concerning the project.
4. **Engagement Level (Ei)**: Measures the participation and communication frequency of the stakeholder.
5. **Influence Impact (Ii)**: Measures the stakeholder's control over resources and decision-making power.
6. **Stakeholder Impact (Si)**: Measures the impact the project has on the stakeholder's role and goals.

##### UI Components

1. **Survey Modal**: A dialog modal that displays survey questions to gather user input for each weight category.
2. **Form Inputs**: Accepts values for each weight `(We, Wi, Ws, Ei, Ii, Si)`, and sends them to the backend for EPS calculation.
3. **Result Display**: Shows the calculated EPS and the priority level of the stakeholder after form submission.

##### How It Works

1. **Survey Modal**: For each weight category, the user can launch a survey modal, answer the questions, and get a score. The score is normalized between 0 and 1 and used as the weight  for that category.

2. **EPS Calculation**: After inputting all the required weights, the user submits the form, which sends a POST request to the backend API with the weight data.

3. **Backend Integration**: The API processes the request and calculates the EPS index (EPSi) and priority level based on the input values.

4. **Result Display**: Once the calculation is complete, the EPS score and priority are displayed to the user.
